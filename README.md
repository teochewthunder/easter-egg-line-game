# Easter Egg Line Game (in progress)

This is a game written using an older version of VueJS. The objective is to select eggs from the grid in an unbroken line (not neccessarily a *straight* line, but horizontally and vertically), which will in turn fill up colors on a rainbow. Once the rainbow is completed or the user runs out of moves, the game ends and points are tallied.
